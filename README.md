## What is GoTrade?
GoTrade is an equity trading simulator Written in GoLang. The projects sole purpose is to serve as a learning environment for myself. I felt that the equities market provided enough complexity to learn about writing large scale GoLang projects, while also already having all of the technical issues solved. Recently I've also become a lot more interested in finance, so this doubles up as a way to learn more about the world dddof finance.
